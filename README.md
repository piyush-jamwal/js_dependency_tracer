# 📦 JS Dependency Tracer

A CLI tool that **traces JavaScript / TypeScript project dependencies starting from any entry file** and builds a **full dependency tree including file contents**.

It safely parses modern code including:

✅ React / React Native (JSX)  
✅ TypeScript  
✅ NestJS (decorators)  
✅ Optional chaining / dynamic imports  
✅ Circular dependency detection

This tool is useful when you want to:

🔍 Understand unfamiliar codebases  
🧭 See how modules relate  
📦 Extract only relevant files  
🤖 Feed structured code context into AI tools  
🛠 Refactor safely
